                        Returning to Rural Roots
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wisconsin rocker launches solo album of folksy blues and light country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Growing up in a rural area north of Appleton, Wisconsin, Tom Thiel was never at a loss for
                        tinkering
                        with his hands and staying busy. While balancing chores and helping keep a nearby neighbor’s
                        farm
                        productive, music caught Tom’s heart. There was always something playing in the background in
                        the
                        Thiel house to homework or housework.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Thiel had music in his blood. His mother considered studying opera in college and his
                        grandfather,
                        Roman, had a passion for music and playing concertina. Tom’s parents wanted to continue the
                        musical
                        tradition in the family and paid for some piano lessons. After a year of dabbling in ivory,
                        Thiel
                        quit the lessons and began soul searching for how his love for music could translate into
                        something
                        useful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unable to afford his own instrument in a household where younger brother, Greg, seemed to get an
                        early jump on music from his crib, Thiel made an instrument out of wood and different sized
                        nails in
                        fifth grade. The custom instrument turned heads in grade school as a project and tuned his
                        confidence up a notch to learn to play guitar. While saving money to buy a used guitar as a
                        teen,
                        Thiel’s determination led him to learning how to play something musical before he even held a
                        six-string in his hands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “I took the plastic case from a watercolor paint set and wrapped six rubber bands around it to
                        be my
                        guitar strings while drawing a few fret lines on the prototype with a marker,” Thiel recalls. “I
                        learned every chord in my younger brother’s guitar book and from that makeshift guitar neck. It
                        was
                        like I had to prove to my parents and myself all over again that I could be a musician.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thiel’s youthful ingenuity has translated into adult skills in computer programming as well as
                        guitar playing. He works as a learning innovations specialist at Fox Valley Technical College,
                        developing online learning objects for worldwide users designed for a variety of application
                        platforms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Songwriting is like putting together a puzzle of sound and lyrics, and computer programming is
                        also
                        about problem solving or putting together a puzzle,” says Thiel. “They are very similar in the
                        way
                        you create something from nothing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After spending several years traveling the country playing clubs with his brother, Greg, who
                        today
                        is a full-time musician in Nashville, Thiel’s new career at FVTC grounded him in sharpening a
                        musical direction. A current guitarist of 13 years with the award-winning band, Boxkar, Thiel’s
                        new
                        musical path inspired the release of his first solo album, Old Shadows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “I often wrote songs early in the morning after late gigs with Boxkar and felt it was time to
                        put
                        them to use for the enjoyment of others,” reflects Thiel. “These songs are like my children. I
                        wanted what’s best for these songs because I felt that they deserved to be heard and maybe other
                        listeners may find inspiration or even an answer here or there in them.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Old Shadows features nine songs blended in subtle country and blues influences, along with a
                        selection of ballads. The album was recorded by Appleton’s Tony Anders and includes local
                        musicians Andrew Mertens on bass and drummer Matt Geiseke. The sound contrasts Boxkar’s heavier
                        rock roots.
                        “Sometimes it’s cleansing to step outside of a routine and put our daily grinds into music or
                        even on paper,” notes Thiel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thiel’s first single, “Where Your Heart Is,” has already received radio play in Wisconsin and
                        Iowa,
                        and his first supply of CDs sold out at a local retail store. The song’s crisp in-and-out guitar
                        rhythms offer lighter and deeper tones, while the lyrics run love through a test of
                        thought-provoking questions. “Broke Down” is a foot-stomping folky arrangement that portrays
                        ‘what
                        could have been’ with vocal echoes and guitar licks of outlaw country swagger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Songs like “When You’re Gone” serve a blues and country mix while the ballads, “Stuck with Me”
                        and
                        “This Letter” put us on a train where scenes of regret and hope lead us to live and learn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thiel recently received an invitation to join his brother and 80's pop icon Tiffany for a live
                        performance at the Iowa State Fair in late August. The once-in-a-lifetime experience included an
                        eight-hour rehearsal in Nashville before the band departed by bus for Des Moines.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The performance with Tiffany joined other notable milestones for the 48-year-old musician. In
                        2005,
                        he played with Boxkar at the Presidential inauguration, and a few years after
                        the band won a national award at a Hard Rock Café competition in Chicago. At FVTC, Thiel has
                        played
                        an instrumental role in helping the college’s Foundation raise money for scholarships by way of
                        playing live performances at college-wide campaign events.
                    </p>
